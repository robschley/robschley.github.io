      <description>The trope of the Cobbler&amp;rsquo;s children having no shoes seems appropriate here. I&amp;rsquo;ve been a professional software developer for 12 years and I&amp;rsquo;ve never had a personal website&amp;hellip; until now.
It is also interesting how little personal code I have on GitHub and other repositories. The sad truth is that most of the software I&amp;rsquo;ve built since Joomla has been entirely proprietary. And, even worse, many of the apps and sites I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on, no longer exist.</description>

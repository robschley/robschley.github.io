      <description>People often ask why we live on a boat. Here’s the story in a nutshell.
I was laid off from Oseberg back in 2015 because the oil market collapsed. At the time, everyone in the American oil &amp;amp; gas industry was hurting and most companies had to make big cuts just to survive.

      <description>The trope of the Cobbler&amp;rsquo;s children having no shoes seems appropriate here. I&amp;rsquo;ve been a professional software developer for 12 years and I&amp;rsquo;ve never had a personal website&amp;hellip; until now.
It is also interesting how little personal code I have on GitHub and other repositories. The sad truth is that most of the software I&amp;rsquo;ve built since Joomla has been entirely proprietary. And, even worse, many of the apps and sites I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on, no longer exist.</description>

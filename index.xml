      <description>My fianc√© and I live on Stay Foolish, our Island Packet sailboat, with our two dogs. We love to travel, explore, and meet new people. Living on a boat allows us to do all of those things while having the comforts of home wherever we go. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty great.
You can follow our adventures aboard Stay Foolish by liking our Facebook page.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m an experienced software engineer and product developer. I enjoy traveling, sailing, scuba diving, great food, wine, and snark. I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about philosophy, politics, usability, and self-determination. I called New Orleans home for nearly 10 years but now travel on Stay Foolish.
I&amp;rsquo;ve lived an unconventional life which has given me an unconventional perspective. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have it any other way.</description>

      <title>The Cobbler&#39;s Children</title>

      <description>The trope of the Cobbler&amp;rsquo;s children having no shoes seems appropriate here. I&amp;rsquo;ve been a professional software developer for 12 years and I&amp;rsquo;ve never had a personal website&amp;hellip; until now.
It is also interesting how little personal code I have on GitHub and other repositories. The sad truth is that most of the software I&amp;rsquo;ve built since Joomla has been entirely proprietary. And, even worse, many of the apps and sites I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on, no longer exist.</description>
